 Zlib for PS4

 https://zlib.net/

 based on Current release:

    zlib 1.2.11
    
 Compilled with the Official Sony SDK.
 
 No configuration would be set for the compilling process.
 
 If you want, adjust some and recompille the lib for better results.
 
 You may also want to recompille the ZLibTest.pkg with libhb Update 17, since the application loop, now, will run in Core 3 and the UserEntry loop will run in Core 1.
 
 The pkg from the download uses a older version of libhb and will run everything together in the default Core.
 
 For the pkg: Copy a CISO with max size of 200Mb on the root of a USB Drive and rename it to test.ciso, then run the app.
 
 The max size is not absolute. That's just a good meaned hint since everything runs within a Single CPU Core,.....yea well. ^^
 
 -Have Fun & Happy Coding, you monkeys-
